## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview

PreOrder-Food is a Online Food Menu that enables people to see all the food items that are currently available in the restaurant and their respective prices.If he finds the food item that he is seeking for then he can Preorder the food before going to restaurant.

### 1.2. Motivation

There are two main reasons for developing the application:

1.When we go to a restaurant and order some food then the waiter unexpectedly says the food you ordered is not currently available.

2.It sometimes take more time than usual time to get your order.(Waiting time)

This are two bad situations we might face when we go to restaurant.
### 1.3. Problem Definition

So,It would be better if we have a online menu where we can view all food items and respective prices and also supporting one more feature where we can order our food before going to restaurant.

Thats where we developed our project named "PreOrder Food".Which implements the above mentioned solution.
