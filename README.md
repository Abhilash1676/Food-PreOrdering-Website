## 1. Introduction

There are two main reasons for developing the application:

1.When we go to a restaurant and order some food then the waiter unexpectedly says the food you ordered is not currently available.

2.It sometimes take more time than usual time to get your order.(Waiting time)

This are two bad situations we might face when we go to restaurant.
